# Turbo complete 🚀🚀🚀

## Description ✍

Turbo complete is a tool that help you to complete an advert based on the image of your product or specific key words.


## Checklist ☑

For this project I did a chcklist based on the book Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & tensorflow from Aurélien Géron to estimate if the project is valuable using IA.

8 big steps of the checklist

1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.

We have 12 questions to respond to definite our project clearly

- What is the objective of the system you are building?

The objective is to facilitate the writing of an advert. This task can be annoying for certain users and make retenetion damage. 

The goal is to use IA to facilitate this step and improve retention.

The idea is to use IA to write a basic automatic description by recognizing a picture or using keywords.

- How will your solution be used, and what impact will it have?

We want to provide a service using a module or a website capable of turning an image or keywords to a full product description.

Here's the algorithm I have in mind :

This will help companies like Ebay/Vinted/ Leboncoin to convert more posts by making the user more comfortable to do a product description.

- What is the current solution to this problem (if any), and how well does it work?

As for now people can use tools like Jasper or ChatGPT to make product description based on keywords but it is not build-in solutions.

They can't convert an image into a full description as well.

- How can you frame this problem in terms of supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning?

It needs supervised/reinforcement learning as for now.

- What performance metric should you use to evaluate the success of your system?

* the description product is pertinent
* users convert more posts

- Is the performance metric aligned with the business objective?

This perfomance metric is on phase with the business objective

- What assumptions are you making about the problem? Are these assumptions valid?


- How would you solve this problem manually if you had to?

- What kind of data do you need, and how much of it?

I need a large dataset of products to train my model.

- What are the relevant features in the data that will help you solve the problem?

The shape, the color of a product

- How will you verify that your solution is working?

If the input with an image of a product gives a pertinent description as an output

- What are the implications of your solution for future developments?

My solution needs an interface to handle the submission of an image/keywords and display the description of the product
