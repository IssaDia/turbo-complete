# Turbo complete üöÄüöÄüöÄ

## Description ‚úç

Turbo complete is a tool that help you to complete an advert based on the image of your product or specific key words.


## Project Analysis üî¨

For this project I did a checklist based on the book Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & tensorflow from Aur√©lien G√©ron to estimate if the project is valuable using IA.

8 big steps of the checklist

1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.

We have 12 questions to respond to definite our project clearly

- <ins>What is the objective of the system you are building?</ins>

The objective is to facilitate the writing of an advert on application like e-commerce. This task can be annoying for certain users and make retention damage. 

The goal is  to generate an advertisement based on an input image, using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language generation (NLG) techniques.

My system will be able to analyze an image, understand the context then generate a written description that is suitable to use for an advertisement.

The ultimate goal is to help people create engaging and peruasive advertisement or profiles that capture the attention of the target audience.

- <ins>How will your solution be used, and what impact will it have?</ins>


The solution can be used by businesses and organizations that want to help their users to create efficient and quick advertisements. This could have a siginifiant impact on the numbers of advertisements or profiles updated on their plateform. So it could potentially help to increased revenue and sales for these buisinesses

Here's the algorithm I have in mind :

- <ins>What is the current solution to this problem (if any), and how well does it work?</ins>

As for now people can use tools like Jasper or ChatGPT to make product description based on keywords but it is not build-in solutions in applications involving advertisements or updating profiles.

They can't convert an image into a full description as well.

- <ins>How can you frame this problem in terms of supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning?</ins>

This problem can be framed in terms of supervised learning, where the system is trained with a labeled dataset of images and their corresponding name/keywords.

Once the dataset is prepared, the system can be trained using supervised learning algorythms like convolutionnal neural networks (CNN) for image analysis and recurrent neural networks(RNN) for natural language generation.

- <ins>What performance metric should you use to evaluate the success of your system?</ins>

The success of my system can be evaluated using several performance metrics : 

1/ Ad engagement : Measure the number of posts or new profiles will determine if there is more engagement using our system.


2/ Coherence and naturalness : Evaluate the generated content by comparing it to a set of generated content made by humans.

3/ Image revelance : Measure the revelance of the output based on the image passed on input.

4/ Creativity : Measure the diversity and the creativity of the generated content and avoid generic content.

- <ins>Is the performance metric aligned with the business objective?</ins>

These perfomance metrics are aligned the business objective as the ultimate goal is to generate content that improve user engagement and interest.

- <ins>What assumptions are you making about the problem? Are these assumptions valid?</ins>

1/ It have to be a real relationship between the image and the content generated

2/ The image have to contain enough information to generate meaningful content.

3/ The image have to be revelant on the specific context.

4/ The language and writing style have to be appropriate for the target audience.

All these assumptions seems to be valid because it depends on the performance of the system

- <ins>How would you solve this problem manually if you had to?</ins>

If I had to solve the problem manually I would have to :

1/ Check the image to determine their category then think about keyworks associated with the image.

2/ Think about the writing style based on the audience targeted.

3/ Write an ad using all the elements of the previous steps. Make the ad good enough to capture the attention and the interest of the viewer.

4/ Review the error to check for possible grammatical mistakes.

- <ins>What kind of data do you need, and how much of it?</ins>

I need a large and diverse dataset of images to train my model. The dataset should be representative of the type of images that would be submit. 

The images in the dataset should be hight quality and have enough complexity to ensure the system can effectively handle a range of images.

I need different type of ad in terms of language too.

The amount of data will depend on the complexity of the system and the quality of them.

Ideally we will use a very large amount of data for this system to have the best performance we can.

However, a large amount of data could be challenging in termes of poccessing and training.


- <ins>What are the relevant features in the data that will help you solve the problem?</ins>
1/ Visual features : like colors, objects and composition of the image.

2/ Product information : Includes information about the product sush as its features, benefits,...

3/ Target audience information : like interests, demographics, budgets, preferences. Can be used for more fitting ads

4/ Ad strategy information : Goal of the ad, the tone ...

5 / Language and writing style : This can ensure that the generated ad is appropriate for the target audience.

- <ins>How will you verify that your solution is working?</ins>

1/ Human verification : We can have a person to review that the generated ad is coherent and provide us with feedback on the quality, the revelance,...

2/ A/B testing : Compare an ad generated manually and an ad generated by AI. Can help verify that our system is performant.

3/ Performance metrics : Check the engagement, the conversion rates for businesses that use our system.

4/ Continuous monitoring : Check the performance overtime to ensure that it remains effective and revelant.

- <ins>What are the implications of your solution for future developments?</ins>

My solution needs an interface to handle the submission of an image/keywords and display the description of the product
