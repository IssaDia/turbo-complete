For this project I did a chcklist based on the book Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & tensorflow de Aurélien Géron to estimate if the project is valuable using IA.

8 big steps of the checklist

1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Explore the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms.
5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones.
6.Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.
Present your solution.
7. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
